Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis using Python and RoBERTa Model


This repository contains a Python-based solution for performing sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using the RoBERTa model. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on classifying Amazon reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. Amazon reviews provide a rich dataset for sentiment analysis, as they encompass a wide range of opinions and emotions from customers.

This project utilizes the RoBERTa model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to perform sentiment classification on Amazon reviews. By training the model on a labeled dataset of Amazon reviews with their corresponding sentiment labels, we can create a reliable sentiment analysis tool.



## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone (https://github.com/JemmyAzuka/Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python-and-Roberta-Model.git)

Navigate to the project directory: cd Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python-and-Roberta-Model.git

Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

Prepare your Amazon review dataset or use the provided dataset.

Preprocess the dataset (tokenization, padding, etc.).

Train the RoBERTa model on the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluate the trained model's performance on a validation/test set.

Use the trained model to predict sentiments for new Amazon reviews.



## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the dataset folder. It consists of Amazon reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).



## Results

Our trained RoBERTa model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation dataset. Further details about precision, recall, and F1-score can be found in the results section of our project documentation.



## Future Enhancements

Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

Experiment with different transformer models.

Implement a web interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
